# The SEC package 
refers to the implementation of a **"Saga Execution Coordinator"** (SEC) in the context of an event-driven architecture. This package is a key component that enables the management of distributed transactions through sagas, which are sequences of steps that define the actions and trade-offs required in a distributed system. Here is a summary of the components and functions of the SEC package:

## Orchestrator: 
Handles incoming responses to determine which saga step to execute next. It has two modes of operation: manual start or reaction to incoming responses.

## Saga Definition: 
Contains the metadata and sequence of steps of the saga, establishing how the saga should operate.

## Steps: 
The steps contain the logic of the saga. They generate command messages sent to participants and can modify the data associated with the saga.

The SEC package centralizes the orchestration logic of a saga's actions in one place, facilitating the management of complex and distributed processes. This is essential in systems where coordination between multiple components is required and where actions must be compensated in case of errors or failures. Using an SEC helps maintain consistency and integrity of operations throughout the application, especially in microservices architectures or distributed systems.
